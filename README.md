## Overview

### TODO

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt that the parent element of the image that will need to be absolutely positioned will need a position:relative property so that the absolutely positioned element will adhere to the parent element, rather than adhering to body as a parent element. 

### Continued development

I still need a lot of practice with absolutely positioned elements as it is very difficult to keep it in place in different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-stack-elements-in-css/) - This helped me for making absolutely positione elements. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
